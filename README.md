# Towards Copeland Optimization in Combinatorial Problems

## Directory Structure
* `README.md`: This file.
* `simple_diversity.py`: The file opens a model from the models directory, runs solves the constraint satisfaction problem, and then writes the solution to a pickled file. The pickled file stores all the solutions, utilities from all agents, and the copeland score over all solutions(referred to as the ground truth in the paper). This stores the pickled files in a directory titled with the model name followed by '_profiles' in the home directory.
* `iterative_copeland.py`: This contains our implementation of the copeland voting method. 
* `deletion_copeland.py`: Our proposed budgeted deletion copeland approach(in the paper referred to as Default Search). This file also produces plots of the copeland scores of our approach compared to the ground truth. There's also an option to produce a gif of how the solution pool evolves over time. Note: this file is meant to run right after the simple_diversity.py file.
* `diversity_copeland_search.py`: Our proposed diversity maximization copeland approach(in the paper referred to as Diversity Maximization). It works directly with the model to propagate new constraints in the model. Note: this file is meant to run right after the simple_diversity.py file. 
* `debug`: Logs the various scripts.
* `models`: Various benchmark models used to test our implementation on.
    * `simple_diversity_mixin.mzn`: diversity constraint for all models in the folder.
* `plots`: The plots generated by the scripts for each model.
